# Major-Project-Web-App-Bug-Bounty-
## Project Description
Web application penetration testing, commonly referred to as "pen testing," is a security testing
process that involves assessing the security of a web application by identifying and exploiting
vulnerabilities that could be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt
the regular operation of the application. Web application penetration testing, also known as
web app pen testing, is the process of identifying vulnerabilities in a web application by
attempting to exploit its weaknesses. This is typically done by using various tools and
techniques to simulate attacks that a malicious hacker might use, with the goal of identifying
and remedying any security flaws before they can be exploited by real attackers. The ultimate
aim is to improve the web application's security posture and protect against potential security
breaches. Basically, WAPT (Web Applications and Penetration Testing) is finding web app-based
vulnerabilities on Websites. In this project, we will find vulnerabilities and exploit them and we
also give remediation of those vulnerabilities.

The pen testing process involves the following steps:

1.Planning and reconnaissance : In this initial phase, the pen tester gathers information
about the web application, such as its functionality, architecture, and technologies used.

2.Vulnerability scanning : The pen tester uses automated tools to scan the application
for known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file
inclusion vulnerabilities.

3.Manual testing : The pen tester manually probes the application to identify and exploit
vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by automated tools. This can involve attempting
to bypass authentication mechanisms, injecting malicious code into the application, or
manipulating input fields to access unauthorized data.

4.Reporting : The pen tester prepares a report that summarizes the findings of the pen
testing process, including identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations
for addressing them.

Overall, the goal of web app pen testing is to identify security weaknesses in the application so
that they can be addressed before attackers exploit them. By conducting regular pen testing,
organizations can ensure that their web applications remain secure and protected against
potential threats.
